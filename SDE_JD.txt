Role Overview
The Generative AI Specialist will be a key member of our AI development team, responsible for designing, developing, and deploying cutting-edge applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative technologies. You will work on a variety of projects, from creating novel customer-facing features to building internal tools that enhance productivity. This role requires a deep understanding of GenAI concepts, strong programming skills, and a passion for staying on the leading edge of this rapidly evolving field.

Key Responsibilities
Design and Development: Architect, build, and maintain scalable and robust applications leveraging generative AI models (LLMs, diffusion models, etc.).

Prompt Engineering: Develop and refine sophisticated prompt engineering strategies to elicit accurate, relevant, and safe outputs from foundation models.

Model Integration & Fine-Tuning: Integrate proprietary and third-party foundation models (e.g., Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT series, open-source models) into our application stack. Fine-tune smaller, open-source models on custom datasets for specific tasks.

RAG Implementation: Design and implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, utilizing vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma, Vertex AI Vector Search) to ground models in factual, up-to-date information.

Prototyping & PoCs: Create rapid prototypes and proofs-of-concept to demonstrate the potential of new GenAI solutions to stakeholders and product teams, much like in a demo creation environment.

Evaluation & Optimization: Establish metrics and evaluation frameworks to assess model performance, quality, and cost. Optimize applications for latency, throughput, and resource consumption.

Collaboration: Work closely with cross-functional teams, including product managers, data scientists, and software engineers, to translate business requirements into technical solutions.

Research & Innovation: Stay at the forefront of GenAI research, trends, and best practices, and champion the adoption of new technologies and techniques within the organization.

Required Qualifications
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a related technical field.

3+ years of hands-on experience in software development or machine learning.

Proven proficiency in Python and its core data science/ML libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

Demonstrable experience working with LLMs via APIs (e.g., Google Gemini API, OpenAI API, etc.).

Solid understanding of core GenAI concepts, including transformers, embeddings, vector databases, and RAG architecture.

Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently and in a team environment.
