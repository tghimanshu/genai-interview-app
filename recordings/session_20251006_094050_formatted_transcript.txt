[2025-10-06T09:40:57.799Z] ASSISTANT: Hi Himanshu, thanks for joining. I'm Alex, a Senior Technical Interviewer here. I've been with the company for about ten years, and today, I'm excited to learn more about your experience.

This interview will be about 15 minutes. We'll start with a quick chat about your background, then move into some technical questions, and finally, we'll reserve some time for any questions you might have for me.

How are you doing today, and do you have any initial questions before we begin?

[2025-10-06T09:41:36.477Z] ASSISTANT: Thanks for asking Himanshu. In this role, you'd be designing, developing, and deploying applications using large language models and other generative technologies. You'd also focus on prompt engineering, integrating and fine-tuning models, and implementing retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. You'd be involvedin prototyping, evaluating, and optimizing solutions, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

Does that help clarify the responsibilities?
[2025-10-06T09:42:03.764Z] USER: Yes, it does.
[2025-10-06T09:42:08.823Z] ASSISTANT: Great. So, looking at your resume, you have some interesting experience at Google as a Project Management Apprentice, and also as an Associate Software Engineer at Go Digital Technology Consulting. Could you tell me about a project you worked on that you found particularly challenging, and how you approached solving it?
[2025-10-06T09:42:28.834Z] USER: So one of the projects I got to work on as a specialist who was an end to end pipeline to create a audio book from a single prompt where I had to work with different technologies like video generators image generators as well as text to speech engines to make sure that everything I end up writing as a prompt gets turned into multiple segments like stories then the characters then the scenes into the intermediate
[2025-10-06T09:43:14.978Z] ASSISTANT: That sounds like a complex project. So you were essentially building an end-to-end pipeline to generate an audio book from a single prompt, involving video, image, and text-to-speech generators. What was the most challenging aspect of integrating these different technologies and ensuring they worked seamlessly together?
[2025-10-06T09:43:36.019Z] USER: So during the time there were no engines which would allow us to integrate all the different segments together and technologies together. I had to write my own workflow to achieve that and the pipeline which would work efficiently by itself which could now be solved with ADK or language change to be precise. On top of that one of the biggest challenges was consistency throughout the pipeline process so that the end result doesn't have a mismatch of random
[2025-10-06T09:44:09.215Z] ASSISTANT: Okay so the biggest challenge was actually the lack of existing tools to integrate all these different generative segments. You had to essentially build your own workflow and pipeline from scratch to ensure a consistent output. Could you elaborate a bit more on how you ensured consistency across the different generated elements like stories, characters, and scenes, especially when dealing with various language options?
[2025-10-06T09:44:38.475Z] USER: Yes so I started out creating a first storyline and it started on getting more and more context using those story lines and I was passing the previously generated storylines and characters as the next prompts context as a system prompt to ensure that everything which is generated post that prompt gets the previous prompts details
[2025-10-06T09:45:19.991Z] ASSISTANT: So you essentially created a chain of prompts, where the output of one prompt, like a storyline or character description, became the context for the next prompt. This sounds like a form of prompt engineering to maintain narrative consistency. How did you handle the potential for drift or unexpected outputs when chaining these generative steps together, especially with multiple languages involved?

[2025-10-06T09:46:27.560Z] ASSISTANT: That's a very thorough approach, using logging and cross-verification at each step. So, you started by generating the dialogues in English and then offered the option to either translate or completely regenerate in other languages, which is smart for idioms.

Given your experience in prompt engineering and this pipeline, how do you approach evaluating the quality and performance of the generated content, especially when you're dealing with subjective aspects like narrative flow or character consistency across different languages?

[2025-10-06T09:47:28.881Z] ASSISTANT: That's a very comprehensive approach. So you combine human analysis with metrics like error word counts, localization ratings, and even used another AI agent for cross-verification. That's quite advanced.

Beyond this, the job description mentions RAG implementation and using vector databases. Can you briefly explain what Retrieval-Augmented Generation is and why vector databases are crucial for its effective implementation?
[2025-10-06T09:47:55.686Z] USER: So recently I was studying for Harvard CS50 and that's where I even reappeared that they used rack for their own AI agent which allows them to actually retrieve specific information for their organization when we are trying to get the data as LLM currently only holds the data which was fed into it. So to enhance the user experience with the data from the organization it is passed to induce RAGN model which is the data is quite small and there is
[2025-10-06T09:48:48.047Z] ASSISTANT: That's a great explanation. So RAG helps LLMs provide more relevant and up-to-date information by retrieving external data, especially useful for specific organizational context where fine-tuning a model might be overkill for smaller datasets. And vector databases are crucial because they store embeddings, allowing for efficient similarity searches to quickly find that relevant information.

That makes a lot of sense. We're nearing the end of our time. Do you have any questions for me about the role, the team, or the company?
