[2025-09-29T06:52:38.304Z] ASSISTANT: Hello Himanshu, my name is Alex, and I'll be interviewing you today. I've reviewed your resume and I'm excited to learn more about your experience.

To start, could you please tell me about your experience as a Generative AI Specialist at Google and how you've applied your skills in developing and deploying cutting-edge applications using Large Language Models?
[2025-09-29T06:53:04.498Z] USER: So I was responsible at Google to create generative AI solutions for multiple customers where I created story generators video generators and like for insurance for health care for shopping. So have been part ofa lot of solutions where we have used Gemini view three nation and agent spaces
[2025-09-29T06:53:30.026Z] ASSISTANT: That's impressive. You've clearly worked on a diverse range of generative AI solutions. Could you elaborate on a specific project where you designed and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation orRAG pipeline? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
[2025-09-29T06:53:48.902Z] USER: So with RNG pipelines we had to basically use documents to retrieve data. So we created a lag engine NGCP and later on used it in a Python ADK application to retrieve using the corpus and get the data and the vector database helped us or not which was directly created using the range in the engine
[2025-09-29T06:54:22.754Z] ASSISTANT: That's a clear explanation of your RAG implementation. You mentioned using a vector database. Can you tell me more about your experience with different vector databases like Pinecone, Chroma, or Vertex AI Vector Search? Have you worked with any of these specifically, and what are your thoughts on their strengths and weaknesses?
[2025-09-29T06:54:41.539Z] USER: Yeah so I have worked only with Google's vertex AI vector search to basically create applications which uses the capabilities of vector search to derive insights quicker and get the right data sets we require.
[2025-09-29T06:54:56.998Z] ASSISTANT: Understood. So your primary experience with vector databases is with Google's Vertex AI Vector Search. That's good to know.

Finally, could you share your approach to staying current with the rapidly evolving field of Generative AI? What resources do you find most valuable, and how do you incorporate new knowledge into your work?
[2025-09-29T06:55:19.303Z] USER: So there are new newsletters I tend to read like super human round AI and AI weekly on top of that I try to read research papers I recently read the chat open AI's new research paper and try to stay up to date with the new and upcoming technologies by Google and Open AI to make sure that I can test them out and experiment with them on a regular basis.
[2025-09-29T06:55:48.615Z] ASSISTANT: That's an excellent approach to continuous learning. It sounds like you're very proactive in keeping up withthe latest in Generative AI. We've covered a lot in our discussion today. Thank you for your time, Himanshu. I hope you have a great day.
